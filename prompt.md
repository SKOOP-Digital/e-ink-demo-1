I have this menu we use for digital signage interactive menus for restaurants.
you have a new client who wants something similar for an e-ink android tablet. However we need to rethink the UI/UX to make it more useable on an e-ink screen.
For example, light text on a dark background is hard to read, small thin font are hard to see, the scrolling of the menu is awful because of the e-ink lag same as for clicking any buttons which takes a second for the screen to refresh leaving the user to not know if the action took. 
you need to use the best UI/UX strategies for making e-ink interactive apps more useable.   
you need to use clever workarounds and strategies for improving the user expierience on the low refresh rate screen.

Here are some tips for making e-ink interactive apps more useable:

```
Use Clear, Bold Typography: Choose fonts with thicker strokes and avoid thin or intricate typefaces. Sans-serif fonts or uniform-stroke serif fonts work best, as they maintain legibility on low-refresh screens​. . A sturdy font (e.g. a medium-weight sans-serif) ensures that letters don’t disappear or look faint on an e-ink display.

High Contrast: Ensure a high contrast ratio between text/icons and background. Black text on a white background is ideal for readability on e-ink. Aim for at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text as recommended by accessibility standards​
. Given e-ink’s typically pale background and limited color, using pure black and white (or black on light gray) maximizes legibility. Avoid relying on subtle color differences – many e-ink screens only support grayscale, and color e-ink has very washed-out hues​


Instead of continuous scrolling, organize content into discrete pages or cards. Implement clear visual hierarchies with generous spacing between elements. Use pagination controls rather than scroll bars. Design tap targets of at least 48x48 pixels to ensure easy interaction.

Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions, even before the screen refresh completes. Use simple animations or state changes that work well with partial screen refreshes. Implement a "debounce" delay on interactive elements to prevent accidental double-taps during refresh cycles.

Structure information hierarchically to minimize navigation depth. Use progressive disclosure patterns - show essential information first with options to view more details. Implement a clear "back" mechanism that works reliably with the refresh cycle.

Structure information hierarchically to minimize navigation depth. Use progressive disclosure patterns - show essential information first with options to view more details. Implement a clear "back" mechanism that works reliably with the refresh cycle.

Organize menu into clear categories with large, easily tappable buttons
Show 4-6 items per page to maintain readability
Include page numbers and clear next/previous controls
Provide a persistent "home" button to return to main categories

Show basic item information (name, price) at category level
Use expandable sections for detailed descriptions
Optimize images for e-ink display (high contrast, larger size)
Include clear indicators for dietary restrictions or special itemscx 

Avoid Visual Clutter: Keep the layout simple and flat. Do not layer UI elements or use drop shadows and gradients that the e-ink cannot render well​
. For example, avoid translucent overlays or complex backgrounds; these can look muddy or introduce ghosting artifacts. Use solid backgrounds and clean lines. In a restaurant menu context, a simple list of items on a plain background will be clearer than a textured background or fancy shadows.

Why: Optimizing UI elements in this way leverages e-ink’s strengths (sharp text, paper-like look) and avoids its weaknesses. High contrast and bold fonts improve readability, and simplifying visuals reduces the number of screen refreshes needed. A clean, static layout prevents the user from struggling with slow-scrolling or missing content. In practice, an e-ink interface should feel more like reading a printed page – clear and uncluttered.

Paginated Content: Replace scrolling with pagination wherever possible​
. Divide information into discrete pages or sections that fit on one screen. Users can tap or swipe to advance page by page, similar to turning pages in an e-reader. This approach is already used in e-book readers and works well given e-ink limitations. For example, a restaurant e-ink menu could show one menu category per page (Appetizers on one page, Main Courses on the next, etc.), avoiding a long scrolling list.

Tap or Swipe Navigation: Implement simple gestures like taps or swipes to move between pages or list items. Scrolling on e-ink is slow and leaves visual artifacts (ghost images of previous content)​
GITHUB.COM
, so a single gesture that jumps to the next view is preferable. For instance, tapping a "Next" arrow or swiping left could load the next page of content in one quick refresh. This “tap-to-scroll” concept advances nearly a full page with one tap, instead of a smooth scroll​
GITHUB.COM
. It’s essentially treating the interface like a series of slides rather than a long canvas.


Sequential Navigation for Lists: If some scrolling is unavoidable (e.g. a long list of items), use stepwise navigation. For example, pressing a down button could scroll the list by one item or one row at a time, rather than pixel-by-pixel. This ensures each step is a quick partial refresh and content aligns to the screen grid without mid-refresh tearing. One strategy is to design list views that scroll a full item into view with each action (almost like a carousel of list items) – the user always sees content snapped to the grid, not half-cut-off lines.


Avoid Animated Transitions: Do not use animated scrolling or sliding menus on e-ink; they will look choppy and leave ghosts​
WITHINTENT.COM
. Instead, use instant or near-instant transitions. For example, rather than a menu smoothly sliding in, it can appear as a static overlay or simply replace the screen with no animation. E-ink cannot achieve the fluid motion of LCDs, so it’s better to cut directly to the end state of a transition. Design navigation flows that feel more like flipping or swapping whole screens.

Provide Clear Page Indicators or state markers: Since users won’t scroll, provide cues about navigation context. Page numbers, progress dots, or section titles help users understand where they are. For instance, a digital menu might show “Page 2 of 5 – Main Courses” at the top, so the user knows how to navigate forward or back. This manages expectations in lieu of scrollbars.

Fast Gesture Recognition: Ensure the UI quickly recognizes navigation gestures (tap, swipe, or hardware button press) and triggers the screen update. There will be a delay in the screen visibly updating, but the system should start processing the navigation immediately on input. For example, on a swipe gesture, you might briefly invert the page (flash a quick black overlay or a small part of the screen) to acknowledge the swipe, then show the next page, or change a clicked button to a differant style once clicked (for partial refresh screenes). This kind of immediate acknowledgement helps the user feel the navigation is responsive even if loading the next page takes half a second.

Immediate Visual Feedback: When a button is tapped, change its appearance at once – even if the underlying action is still processing. For example, highlight the button or invert its colors on touch. This can often be done with a quick partial refresh of that button area, which takes only a few hundred milliseconds. Immediate feedback assures the user that the system received the command​

Disable or Debounce After Activation: Once a button is pressed, consider disabling it or visually indicating it’s in a pressed state until the action completes. This prevents multiple rapid presses. Since e-ink won’t show multiple quick clicks distinctly, debouncing is important. You might change the label to “Processing…” or show a subtle overlay to indicate the tap was registered. If the next screen or result is loading, this state can remain until the update. This strategy avoids the user tapping again out of uncertainty.

Tactile/Audio Feedback: If the hardware allows, supplement visual feedback with a subtle vibration or click sound on button press. Many e-ink devices (especially prototypes or custom hardware like e-ink tablets or menus) might include a haptic motor or speaker.In a quiet restaurant setting, a soft gentle “beep” or click could serve a similar purpose. 


Larger, Well-Spaced Touch Targets: Because e-ink touchscreens can have less sensitivity or slower touch scanning​, design buttons that are generously sized and spaced to avoid mis-taps. A user shouldn’t have to precisely hit a tiny UI element. For instance, make sure a finger-sized area (at least ~7mm or 44px diameter) is active for each button. In a menu, each menu item or on-screen button (like “Add to Order”) should be large enough that even with a slight touch lag the correct item registers. This not only improves accuracy but also speeds up interaction since the user doesn’t need to tap multiple times or press very hard.

Consistent Placement: Keep interactive buttons in consistent locations and use a predictable layout. If “Next” is always at the bottom-right, the user can quickly tap it without re-reading the whole screen. On e-ink, where each interaction has a cost in time, making the UI predictable reduces the cognitive load and hesitation before pressing a button. This indirectly makes the interface feel more responsive since the user is more confident in where to tap and can do so faster.


Font Choice and Weight: As mentioned, favor sans-serif fonts or clean serif fonts with medium-to-thick strokes. Avoid ultra-light font weights. Fine details in type can disappear or cause flickering on e-ink. A font like Helvetica, Fira Sans, or a slab-serif like Rockwell can work well – they have consistent stroke widths and clear shapes. Studies have noted that lower-contrast typefaces (not too much difference between thick/thin strokes) are more readable on lower-resolution displays like older e-ink​. Essentially, no hairlines: fonts similar to Bodoni or Didot (with very thin serifs) should be avoided​. Instead, use fonts designed for screen legibility. Many e-readers use fonts like Caecilia, Bookerly, or Noto Sans for this reason. Ensure the font rendering is in black or near-black for maximum clarity.

Comfortable Font Size: Use sufficiently large text sizes, especially for body text or important information. Small text can be problematic on e-ink if the resolution is limited or under low light.

Line Length and Spacing: Format text in reader-friendly layouts. Limit line lengths to a reasonable character count (around 50–80 characters per line is often recommended for readability). Extremely long lines cause eye strain, while very short lines break reading flow. Use adequate line spacing (leading) so that lines of text don’t blur together – e-ink can have slight ghosting which might make lines appear to touch if too tight. Generous margins and padding around text blocks also help emulate a comfortable reading experience​. Essentially, mimic the traits of a well-laid-out printed page. For example, a menu might center text in each section with some padding, or use bullet points with enough spacing that each item is distinct.

Contrast and Background: We reiterate the importance of contrast for readability. On e-ink, the “background” is usually a grayish-white. Use pure black (#000000) for text for maximum contrast. If you need to use a secondary text color (for less important info), use a dark gray (e.g. #555) but be cautious – too light a gray can be illegible on e-ink’s off-white screen. The contrast ratio for all text should ideally meet WCAG guidelines (4.5:1 for normal text)​
. Avoid using inverted text (white on black) for large passages, as that can cause more ghosting (large black areas leave afterimages). Inverse text is fine for small elements (like a highlighted button or an icon). Also avoid patterned or image backgrounds behind text – the simpler the background, the better the text will read. If the device has a front-light or color temperature setting, recommend using a neutral setting; overly warm light on e-ink can lower contrast slightly (though that’s user-controlled, not your design).

Icons and Symbols: Treat icons like text in terms of clarity. If you use iconography (e.g. a vegetarian symbol on a menu item or arrows for navigation), make sure they are simple and high-contrast. Avoid intricate icon designs. Use solid fills or clear outlines. For example, a simple checkmark or X icon should be bold enough that it doesn’t fade. If using any icon font or SVG, ensure strokes are thick. Test icons in multiple states of refresh to ensure no pieces disappear.

Consistent Styling: Maintain consistency in text styling throughout the interface. Because e-ink doesn’t handle subtle style differences well, use bold and italics sparingly (they might not show as clearly as on color screens). Instead of using a light gray to denote disabled text (which might be hard to see), you might use a label like “[Unavailable]” or a pattern (like a strikethrough or dimmed pattern) along with a slight color change. The key is to not rely on faint visual differences for meaning. If something is important, make it clearly visible; if something is secondary, you can show it smaller or in parentheses rather than a low-contrast color.

Partial Refresh Updates: Whenever possible, update only the portion of the screen that needs to change, rather than refreshing the entire display. Many e-ink screens support partial refresh modes where a small region (for example, an area where a button was pressed or a single list item) can be updated in a fraction of the time of a full-screen refresh. This means if only a small element changes (like highlighting a selection or updating a number), you can give feedback much faster (~0.3s) than doing a full-screen blink​
Partial updates also avoid the full flash/flicker effect, so the change appears more seamlessly. For instance, if the user toggles a checkbox on a form, you can invert that checkbox without redrawing the whole screen. Note: Partial refresh can introduce some mild ghosting where the old content was, so use it for minor changes or in-between full refreshes.

Periodic Full Refresh: Because partial updates can degrade the display quality over several operations (ghosting accumulates), ensure you perform a full-screen refresh at strategic intervals​
A common rule of thumb (and manufacturer recommendation) is to do a full refresh after, say, 5–10 partial updates​
his will clear any ghost images and reset the display for crisp text again. You might coordinate full refreshes with natural pauses or boundaries in the user flow. For example, in a menu app, you might allow the user to page through a few screens with partial refresh (for speed), but when they reach the end of a section or after a certain number of page flips, trigger a full refresh (perhaps disguised as a brief flash or a “Please wait” overlay) to clear the screen. Some e-ink apps let users choose this balance – e.g., Kindle’s “Page Refresh” option, which if turned off uses partial updates for faster page turns but still does a full refresh occasionally (like at chapter boundaries) to prevent ghosting​
The key is to manage ghosting: don't let it build to the point of ruining readability, but also don't flash so often that it annoys the user.

Optimized Drawing: Plan your UI drawing logic to minimize unnecessary refreshes. On an LCD, you might update the screen frequently (even 60 times a second) for animations or transitions. On e-ink, you want to update as rarely as possible. So structure your code to only trigger a display refresh when something actually changes. Batch changes together – if multiple elements must update, try to update them all at once in a single refresh cycle rather than one-by-one (this avoids multiple flashes). Also consider double-buffering if the platform allows: render the next screen off-screen and then push it to the display in one go. This way the user doesn’t see intermediate states. Many e-ink systems inherently use a framebuffer approach where you compose an image then send it to the screen – leverage that to make each update purposeful and complete.

Predictive or Anticipatory Updates: Improve perceived performance by anticipating what the user might do next and preparing for it. For example, if your app has a “Next page” button, you could start loading or rendering the next page’s content in memory while the user is reading the current page. Then when they tap next, the response can appear faster because much of the work (data fetch, layout, etc.) is already done – only the display refresh is needed. In a menu scenario, if the user is viewing appetizers, you might quietly load the data for main courses in the background, assuming they’ll go there next. Or if they’re on page 1 of a list, preload page 2. This kind of prefetching can hide the computation/IO delay, so the limiting factor becomes just the e-ink refresh. Caution: Don’t preload too aggressively (limited device memory and battery), but focus on likely next actions. This strategy is widely used in e-readers (they pre-cache the next chapter pages) to make actions feel instantaneous.

User Feedback for Long Operations: If an operation takes longer (e.g., syncing data, connecting to Wi-Fi, downloading an update), use a progress indicator or at least a message. As noted earlier, avoid a rapidly animating spinner. Instead, consider when performing a full refresh cycle that takes 2 seconds, you could show a series of dots (“Updating... ••□□”) where the filled dots increase to indicate progress. This only changes a small part of the screen and not too rapidly. The goal is to reassure the user that the device isn’t frozen​. On e-ink specifically, even a static hourglass icon that appears is better than nothing. It tells the user to wait and that the system is working on it.

Integrate Refresh into UX: Sometimes you can disguise a full refresh as part of the UX flow. For example, when the user submits an order on a menu, you might intentionally flash the screen to a “Thank you” page that has a black background for a second (clearing the screen) and then show the confirmation. This way, the full refresh (white→black→white flicker) is hidden behind a purposeful black interstitial, or like Kindle’s new page-turn animation system which blends pages to mask the refresh – it “seamlessly blends two pages into each other... pages quickly fade into each other”​, reducing the appearance of a hard flash. You can take inspiration from that by creating gentler transitions. In other words, use the e-ink’s need to reset as a design transition.

Optimize Content for Fewer Refreshes: This is more of a content strategy: if certain parts of the UI don’t need frequent updating, leave them static. For example, in a menu app, the header and footer could remain the same across pages (like the restaurant name at top, or navigation buttons at bottom). Only the middle content changes when paging. By keeping some areas constant, the user’s eyes have a stable reference, and you may even choose not to refresh those areas every time (on some e-ink controllers you can update only a region). This not only speeds up the update (less area to refresh) but also avoids the whole screen flickering. Be careful to avoid partial updating the same area too many times in a row – as noted, eventually do a full refresh to keep the text crisp​

Pagination and Sections (proven pattern): Virtually all e-ink reading apps use pagination instead of scrolling – and users are accustomed to it. Kindle, Kobo, Nook, etc., all have “page turn” interactions. Users tap or swipe and the content jumps to the next page. This has proven to be user-friendly and aligns with mental models from books. In your UI, leveraging this pattern will feel natural. It also has the benefit we discussed: it avoids scroll lag. So designing your content as a sequence of pages or cards is a best practice validated by e-ink e-readers and even some e-ink optimized apps (for instance, some web browsers on e-ink tablets offer a “article pagination” mode to slice long web pages). In short, if it works for Kindle, it will likely work for your use case – think of each menu category or info screen as a page to turn, but stilll make sure to create the best design and functionality for the use case, tweaking the strategies as needed.

No Animated Gimmicks: Successful e-ink apps keep the interface mostly static. You won’t see a Kindle home screen with moving carousels or a reMarkable UI with pulsing buttons. They use static icons and menus that appear instantly. This is by design – any unnecessary animation would just slow things down or look bad

Attatched are some samples of an existing menu.

Please create a new menu demo that incorporates the best UI/UX strategies for making e-ink interactive apps more useable as discussed in length above. 

Make sure the menu demo is fully functional, with all the data included in the html file in some way. 

This is a demo to show off a digital menu on e ink tables and optimized for them.

The entire menu app must be within html, js, and css, or json, but no react or any other frameworks, and must use inline or tags for styles and scripts, as the whole thing needss to be in one html file. 

Make sure the menu is well designed for a nice restauraunt, using modern design techniques and above all making sure to adhere to the best UI/UX strategies for making e-ink interactive apps more useable as discussed in length above.
Make sure the design is still fluent, modern, smooth, and beautiful, again, while still adhering to the best UI/UX strategies for making e-ink interactive apps more useable as discussed in length above.

Make sure to make it reasonably complex and stylish.

Make sure the menu is responsive to differant screen sizes.

Avoid too much blockiness.

Make sure any content loading and switching happens as fast as possible after the user interaction trigger.

Provide any files as artifacts.




here is a decent example,
