```thinking
Let me analyze this request carefully:

1. Understanding the context:
- Looking at index.html, it's an e-ink restaurant menu with a French theme
- Currently has menu items across starters, mains, desserts, and drinks
- Some items already have image placeholders but no actual images
- The styling includes grayscale and contrast filters for e-ink optimization

2. Identifying requirements:
- Need to add new menu items that would look visually appealing in B&W
- Should maintain the French restaurant theme
- No need to add actual images, just the menu items
- Should fit naturally with existing menu structure

3. Considering what works well in B&W:
- High contrast subjects
- Clear shapes and silhouettes 
- Textural elements that translate well to grayscale
- Classic plating with clean lines
- Foods with distinct patterns or layers

4. Potential items that would work well:
Starters:
- Oysters on ice (dramatic contrast, clean presentation)
- Black & white truffle risotto (textural interest)
- Stacked vegetable terrine (clear layers)

Mains:
- Rack of lamb (distinctive shape)
- Striped bass with crispy skin (pattern and texture)
- Mushroom wellington (dramatic cross-section)

Desserts:
- Opera cake (distinct layers)
- Pavlova (dramatic shape and texture)
- Dark chocolate soufflé (contrast and form)

5. Implementation approach:
- Will edit the menuData object
- Maintain same price range and description style
- Add items across different categories
- Keep the French culinary theme consistent

6. Validation:
- New items fit theme
- Descriptions match existing style
- Prices align with menu
- Items would indeed photograph well in B&W
```

I'll add some new menu items that would look particularly striking in black and white photography. Let me edit the file:

I've added several new menu items that would look particularly striking in black and white photography. Here's why each would work well:

1. Starters:
- Fresh Oysters on Ice: The contrast between dark oysters and bright crushed ice creates dramatic B&W imagery
- Black & White Truffle Risotto: The texture of the rice and truffle shavings provides great detail
- Vegetable Terrine: The layered pattern would create interesting grayscale gradients

2. Mains:
- Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb: The defined bones and herb crust create strong visual lines
- Striped Bass en Papillote: The crispy skin texture and clean presentation work well in B&W
- Wild Mushroom Wellington: The cross-section reveals dramatic layers and patterns

3. Desserts:
- Gâteau Opéra: The distinct layers of this classic French cake create beautiful contrast
- Black & White Pavlova: The texture of the meringue and contrast with dark chocolate is naturally suited for B&W

When you're ready to add images, look for photos that emphasize:
- Strong contrast between light and dark elements
- Clear textures and patterns
- Clean, uncluttered plating
- Dramatic lighting that highlights the form of the dish

Would you like me to add any other items that would work well in black and white photography?
