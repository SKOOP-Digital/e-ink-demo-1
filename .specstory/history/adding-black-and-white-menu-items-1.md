add some products whose images would look good in black and white.

```thinking
1. Initial Analysis:
- Need to add menu items with images that would look good in black and white on an e-ink display
- Currently examining index.html which contains the menu data structure
- Only a few items currently have image placeholders (coqAuVin and goatCheeseSalad)

2. Key Considerations for B&W Images:
- Strong contrast and clear shapes work best
- Textural details and patterns translate well to B&W
- Simple compositions with clear subject focus
- Foods that have natural monochromatic appeal

3. Suitable Food Items:
Starters:
- Oysters on ice (clean presentation, textural contrast)
- Charcuterie board (varied textures, patterns)

Mains:
- Steak frites (strong contrast between char and plate)
- Soufflé (textural details, dramatic shadows)

Desserts:
- Chocolate mousse (texture and contrast)
- Mille-feuille (layered patterns)
- Profiteroles (shape and shadow detail)

4. Implementation Approach:
- Add base64 placeholder images section
- Add new menu items with images
- Ensure descriptions match visual appeal
- Maintain existing menu structure and pricing style

5. Validation:
- New items should fit thematically with French bistro menu
- Prices should align with existing range
- Descriptions should be appetizing and accurate
```

I'll edit the file to add some visually appealing dishes with placeholder images that would work well in black and white. First, I'll add the placeholder images section.

I apologize for the failed edit. Let me try a more focused approach by adding just a few items at a time.

I apologize for the continued failures. Let me try a different approach by reading the file first to ensure I have the exact context.

Now I can see exactly where to add the new content. Let me try the edit again with the precise location:

I apologize, but I see that I don't have access to read the entire file. Let me try a different approach by making smaller, targeted edits:

```diff
              starters: [
                  {
-                     name: "Fresh Oysters",
-                     description: "Half dozen fresh oysters served on ice with mignonette sauce and lemon",
+                     name: "Fresh Oysters on Ice",
+                     description: "Half dozen fresh oysters served on crushed ice with mignonette sauce and lemon",
                      price: "€24",
                      tags: ["Raw", "Seasonal"],
```

I see that the oysters item already exists. Let me try adding a new item to the mains section instead:
