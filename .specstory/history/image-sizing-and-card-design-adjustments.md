## Image Sizing and Card Design Adjustments (2/7/2025, 10:13:34 PM)

make the images a bit bigger by having them extend to the border of the item cards. 
keep only the left broder for the image by overlapping the image boarder and the card border, so that it looks as if the image border commes out of the card border for its lefgt side, or something similar.

```thinking
Let me analyze the request and plan the necessary changes:

1. Understanding current state:
- Menu items have a border and padding
- Images are contained within the menu item with their own border
- Images are currently 120x120px with some spacing from the card edges

2. Requested changes:
- Make images bigger
- Have them extend to the card edges
- Keep only left border for image
- Create visual effect of image border emerging from card border

3. Implementation approach:
- Remove image border except for left side
- Adjust image dimensions to match card height
- Remove padding on right side of image
- Ensure image aligns perfectly with card edges
- May need to adjust menu-item padding/structure

4. Specific CSS changes needed:
- Modify
