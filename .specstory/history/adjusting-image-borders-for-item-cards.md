## Adjusting Image Borders for Item Cards (2/7/2025, 10:32:12 PM)

_**User**_

make the images a bit bigger by having them extend to the border of the item cards. 
keep only the left broder for the image by overlapping the image boarder and the card border, so that it looks as if the image border commes out of the card border for its lefgt side, or something similar.

```thinking
Let me analyze the request and the current code:

1. Key requirements:
- Make images bigger
- Have images extend to the border of item cards
- Keep only left border for images
- Create visual effect of image border emerging from card border

2. Current implementation:
- Images are contained within menu-item-content with padding
- Images have fixed dimensions (120px x 120px)
- Both card and image have separate borders

3. Approach:
- Remove right border from image container
- Adjust image container positioning to overlap with card border
- Increase image dimensions
- Maintain responsive design
- Keep existing e-ink optimizations

4. Changes needed:
- Modify menu-item-image CSS class
- Adjust menu-item class padding/layout
- Update media queries for responsive behavior

5. Validation:
- Changes should maintain overall layout
- Mobile responsiveness should be preserved
- E-ink display optimizations remain intact
```

I'll edit the CSS to implement these changes. The main changes will be in the style section of the HTML file.

I've made several changes to create the requested effect:

1. Made the images larger (180px width instead of 120px)
2. Created the border overlap effect by:
   - Removing right, top, and bottom borders from the image container
   - Using margin-right: -1px to overlap with the card border
   - Adjusting padding and gaps to maintain clean layout
3. Improved the responsive design:
   - Slightly larger images on tablet (140px)
   - Full-width images on mobile that extend to the edges
   - Better spacing and border handling for all screen sizes

The images now appear to emerge from the left border of the menu item cards, creating a more integrated and visually appealing design while maintaining the e-ink display optimizations. The layout remains responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?
